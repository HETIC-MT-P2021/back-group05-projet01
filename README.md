# La Galeria de Papel - Back

## About

The goal of this project is to create a web app with an image gallery where you can manage your images : add, update and delete images. You will also be able to edit categories and tags to use them in filters.
The real goal of this project is to learn how to use Symfony 5 to make web app.

You are on the Back-end of the Project, we used Symfony to make a REST API, and MySQL as a database.

## How to use

Make sure to start the Back-Office before you start the Front

```
You can now access the API At http://localhost:8001

## Features
